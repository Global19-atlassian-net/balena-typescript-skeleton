# Skeleton Project

This is a skeleton template for a TypeScript project, containing all the default files and settings required for a Resin project. It will build code via `gulp` (there is also a default Visual Code task for this on starting the debugger).

Modify the `package.json`, `.vscode/launch.json` and README.md file as required, `npm install`, then implement code in the `lib` directory.

Compiled code will be output into the `build` directory (transpiled JS, declaration files and source maps).
